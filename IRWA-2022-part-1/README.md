## Introduction

This laboratory is the first part of the project we will be working on for the whole trimester. Our objective is to clean the dataset we are given in order to ease the future task of searching through it, this is the topic for our first part of the project: Text Processing. We have been provided with a dataset of tweets, so we will be doing its preprocessing. We have done it through:
Removing stop words
Tokenization of text
Remove punctuation marks and non-alphanumeric 
Stemming 
etc
With this preprocessing we will be able to create a clean and practical dataset which will be easy to use.

## Assumptions

- All tweets are written in the same language (English). Because of this, we did not take into account special characters (ie: á, ê) that would be something typical in other languages.
- The collection of tweets provided is real information.
- Tweets replying to other tweets are not distinguished from normal tweets.
- All the tweets are still available and have not been deleted.

## Implementation 

All the implementation is explained in the python notebook

## Report
The report of the group is available in a word format, but implementation of the code may change in some parts
